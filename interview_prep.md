## Technical Deep Dives

### 1. Data Architecture

#### Schema Design
```json
{
  "viewing_events": {
    "event_id": "STRING",
    "timestamp": "TIMESTAMP",
    "user_id": "STRING",
    "content_id": "STRING",
    "quality_metrics": {
      "buffering_events": "INTEGER",
      "bandwidth_mbps": "FLOAT",
      "frames_dropped": "FLOAT"
    },
    "engagement_signals": {
      "completion_rate": "FLOAT",
      "rating": "INTEGER"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Data Volume Handling
- 200 content items across 14 genres
- 10,000 users with diverse demographics
- 100,000 viewing events with detailed metrics
- Optimized BigQuery tables and views

### 2. Key Metrics and Patterns

#### Content Distribution
- Animation leads with 23 titles
- Thriller follows with 21 titles
- Average duration 70-100 minutes
- Even genre distribution

#### User Demographics
- Standard plan: 38.88% (3,888 users)
- Basic plan: 26.07% (2,607 users)
- Premium plan: 18.32% (1,832 users)
- Family plan: 8.88% (888 users)
- Student plan: 7.85% (785 users)

#### Viewing Patterns
- Smart TV dominates: 22.07% (22,065 events)
- Desktop second: 19.42% (19,424 events)
- Mobile/Tablet combined: ~34% (33,891 events)
- Gaming/Streaming stick: ~24.6% (24,620 events)

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Data Processing Pipeline
```python
def process_streaming_data():
    # Generate diverse user base
    users = generate_users(10000)
    
    # Create content library
    content = generate_content(200)
    
    # Generate viewing events
    events = generate_events(100000)
    
    # Process in BigQuery
    load_to_bigquery(users, content, events)
```

#### Quality Metrics
```python
def analyze_quality_metrics():
    # Smart TV averages
    # - Bandwidth: 36.1 Mbps
    # - Completion: 61.85%
    
    # Mobile averages
    # - Bandwidth: 26.3 Mbps
    # - Completion: 61.79%
```

### 4. Optimization Techniques

#### BigQuery Performance
```python
# Implemented batch processing
def process_in_batches(events, batch_size=5000):
    for i in range(0, len(events), batch_size):
        batch = events[i:i+batch_size]
        load_to_bigquery(batch)
```

#### Data Generation
```python
def generate_realistic_patterns():
    # Device-specific patterns
    if device_type == "smart_tv":
        bandwidth_range = (30, 200)
    elif device_type == "mobile":
        bandwidth_range = (5, 50)
```

## Common Interview Questions

### Q: How would you scale this system to handle 1M users?
**A:** Currently handling 10K users and 100K events. To scale to 1M users:
1. Implement partitioning in BigQuery
2. Use streaming inserts for real-time data
3. Optimize view materialization
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Q: How do you ensure data quality at this scale?
**A:** With 100K events, we:
1. Implement validation at ingestion
2. Monitor distribution patterns
3. Set up alerts for anomalies
4. Run periodic quality checks

### Q: What were the main technical challenges?
**A:** Key challenges included:
1. Managing 100K events efficiently
2. Generating realistic patterns
3. Optimizing BigQuery performance
4. Creating responsive visualizations

    # Leverage BigQuery best practices
```

### 2. Error Handling
```python
def handle_processing_errors():
    try:
        process_data()
    except DataQualityError:
        log_error()
        implement_fallback()
    finally:
        cleanup_resources()
```

### 3. Testing Implementation
```python
def test_data_pipeline():
    # Unit tests for data processing
    # Integration tests for BigQuery
    # End-to-end testing
```
